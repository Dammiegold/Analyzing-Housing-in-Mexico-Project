Let's take a look on Housing in Mexico


## Introduction
Mexico has a range of housing types, from informal settlements to modern high-rise apartments.Historically, access to affordable housing has been a challenge for many Mexicans, particularly low-income families. The government has implemented various programs and policies to address this issue, including social housing programs and mortgage subsidies.

However, despite these efforts, Mexico still faces a significant housing deficit. In addition to affordability, housing quality and access to basic services like water and sanitation remain pressing issues for many Mexican households. Despite these challenges, Mexico's housing sector continues to evolve and adapt to changing needs and demands.

With a population of almost 130 million, a rich cultural history and diversity, and abundant natural resources, Mexico is among the world's 15 largest economies country.
